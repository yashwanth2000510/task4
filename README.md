I am going to provide two .csv files , you are supposed to work on them and have to provide solutions to the following problems
merge those two csv files (after getting as dataframes, get them as a single dataframe)
Take each csv file , split that csv file into multiple categories (example csv files are added in the repo)
consider if the codekata score exceeds 15000 points(present week) then make a csv on those observations as Exceeded expectations.csv
if 10000<codekata score<15000 (Reached_expectations.csv)
if 7000<codekata score<10000 (Needs_Improvement.csv)
if codekate score < 7000 (Unsatisfactory.csv)
